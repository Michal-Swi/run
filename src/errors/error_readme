Put errors in directories that match the place 
they could be thrown e.g. NoFile error won't be
thrown anywhere other than lexer, so it's place
is in the lexer_errors/ dir

Errors should be constructed like so:

inline constexpr const char* TemplateError = "TemplateError ";
inline constexpr const char* TemplateErrorSpecification = "Specification"

class template_error : public std::exception {
	public:
	const char* what() const noexcept override {
		return "";
	}
};
